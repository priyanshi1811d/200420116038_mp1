        <h1> About Earth </h1>
        <p>
            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that is 
            inhabited by living things.While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it 
            is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger 
            than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which
             are made of rock and metal.

        <h2> About Mountains </h2>
        <p>
            A mountain is a large natural rise of the Earth's surface that usually has a "summit" 
            (the name for a mountain's top, which can also be called a peak). 
            It is usually steeper and taller than a hill. By definition, mountains 
            are often thought of as being a hill which is higher than 600 meters (about 2,000 feet).
             However, some definitions say a mountain is a hill higher than 300 meters (about 1,000 feet).

        <h2> About Islands </h2>
        <p>
            An island is a piece of land that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river, sea 
            or ocean. Islands are smaller than continents. Greenland and Australia are huge islands, but 
            they are built of continental rock, and the latter is generally considered a continent. The 
            most ancient part of continental rock is far older and chemically more complex than the rock 
            of the sea floor.
